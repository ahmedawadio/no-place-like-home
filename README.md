# Nest ML: No Place Like Home

## Introduction

**No Place Like Home** is a full-stack web application that helps discover areas across the United States that share key traits with your hometown. By entering your location, the model utilizes U.S. government data to find places with similar demographics and urban characteristics, assisting in exploring new destinations that feel like home.

## Machine Learning Model Overview

The model identifies similarities between metropolitan areas using clustering techniques on various demographic and urban features.

### Key Steps:

1. **Data Loading and Preparation**:
   - Load data from the U.S. Census ACS survey.
   - Clean the dataset by handling missing values and filtering out features with a high percentage of missing data.

2. **Data Scaling**:
   - Standardize features using `StandardScaler` to ensure each has a mean of zero and unit variance.

3. **Dimensionality Reduction**:
   - Apply Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce dimensionality while retaining 95% of the variance.
   - Enhances computational efficiency and model performance.

4. **Clustering**:
   - Use the KMeans algorithm to cluster locations based on the processed features.
   - Determine the optimal number of clusters using the Elbow Method and Silhouette Analysis.

5. **Nearest Neighbors Identification**:
   - For each location, find the nearest neighbors within its cluster.
   - If insufficient neighbors are found, extend the search to neighboring clusters based on centroid proximity.

6. **Feature Importance Analysis**:
   - Employ a Random Forest Classifier to identify the most significant features contributing to the clustering.
   - Top features include housing age, median rent, poverty levels, and more.

## Data Processing and Analysis

Data processing and model training involve extensive use of data science and AI/ML techniques, utilizing the following key libraries:
